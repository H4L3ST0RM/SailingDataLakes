## John Hale
Hello, I'm John! I'm a data scientist passionate about learning new algorithms and increasing my understanding of 
existing algorithms. Outside of machine learning related stuff, I mostly enjoy spending time with my family. We're big
on hobbies, such as sailing, kayaking, cooking, fishing, swimming, cars, and shark tooth hunting! When I can, I'll 
try and include these activities in my projects.

I decided to start this blog as an accountability tool as I work to better my understanding of various
machine learning related algorithms. So if you, the reader, see any errors or typos in my posts, please email me
so I can resolve it.
